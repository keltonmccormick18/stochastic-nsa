Stochastic Calculus is a subject which requires a lot of heavy mathematical machinery to draw any significant results or intuition. Non-Standard analysis, or the introduction of infinitesimal numbers as objects we can work with, gives an easier lens into some concepts in Stochastic Calculus, and plays well with the common method of approaching solving SDEs, Discretization.

In this introductory document, I explain the underlying mechanism of this application and some intuition as to how it could be useful. I cover the construction, important principles of logic which facilitate our translation, and cover Loeb measure and an alternate, non-standard definition of Brownian Motion.
